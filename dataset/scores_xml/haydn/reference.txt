The score of haydn symphonies was in humdrum format (.krn)
1. Use Verovio Humdrum Viewer to convert to musicxml file (The humdrum parser in music21 does will crash)
2. Use Musecore to open musicxml file and export to musicxml file again because the musicxml exported by verovio cannot be parsed by music21
3. For making piano rolls, export MIDI file with muse directly 

Note. 
hob102.musicxml exported from verovio is damaged and cannot be opened by musecore
Instead, I found the MIDI file of that piece on KernScores : http://kern.humdrum.org/search?s=t&keyword=symphony
Then open MIDI file with musecore then export as musicxml
